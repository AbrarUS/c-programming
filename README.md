# Welcome to the C Programming Learner's Repository!

This repository contains a collection of C programming exercises, examples, and projects to help you get started with learning C.

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

Exercises: These are small programming problems designed to help you practice and improve your C skills.
Examples: These are complete C programs that demonstrate how to use various features of the language.
Projects: These are larger programming projects that put your skills to the test.
To get started, you'll need a C compiler. If you don't already have one installed, you can download and install one for free from the internet. Some popular C compilers include GCC and Clang.

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can compile and run a C program by using the following steps:

Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where your C program is saved.
Type gcc followed by the name of your C program file, and then press Enter. For example: gcc main.c
If the program compiles without errors, it will create an executable file.
To run the program, type ./a.out and press Enter.
We hope you find these resources helpful as you begin your journey to learn C programming. Good luck!
